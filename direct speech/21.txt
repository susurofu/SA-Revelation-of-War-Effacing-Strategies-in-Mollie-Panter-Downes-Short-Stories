‘On a good train service to London, too,’‘It’s really a buy. If we ever want to sell we'll be able to get twice what we're giving, before the war’s over.’ 
‘I'm delighted about Margaret,’ ‘Now, perhaps, you'll get some decent food to eat. So far as I can make out, you and the girl friends have been getting along on lettuce and cups of tea. Your description of the Home where you found her chilled my blood. Pure Dickens, my God! She must think it’s heaven now she and the kid are with you, darling.’
“We have to be very careful, of course, where we place our girls,’ ‘Once they make a mistake of this kind, they so often get into — well, the habit, you might say.’ ‘You say you're at work all day. Would Margaret be likely to see any men while you're out?”
‘None, absolutely none,’ 
‘The father won't worry you — that’s one thing,’ ‘One of these soldiers — married, of course. Somewhere on the Continent now, I suppose, and never a thought for the poor girls, you may be sure.’

‘I wouldn't feel natural as a missis,’ ‘Miss Judd I am and Miss Judd I'll probably stop, and Raymond will have to take it as he finds it. There'll be plenty like him, I daresay.’
‘Why did you call him Raymond?’ ‘Was it his father’s name?”
‘No, it wasn’t,’ ‘His father’s name was George - or he said it was, anyway.’ ‘But I always thought if I got married and had a little boy, I'd call him Raymond. Well, the war happened and I didn’t get married, but I got Raymond.’
‘It's a beautiful name,’
‘If your baby is an active little fellow, this will keep him snug in all weathers,’ ‘Well, yes, he is the active type of baby.’ ‘It’s beautiful!’ 
“Well, we shan’t have to worry now about keeping him warm in the garden,’‘What I mind most is the waste of it all,’ ‘Waste of time, waste of you, waste of the good things ‘we could be doing together.’ 
‘You stay where you are!’
