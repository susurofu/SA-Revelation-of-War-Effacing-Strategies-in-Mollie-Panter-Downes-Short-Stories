‘I do want you to come!’ ‘Effie Trumpington is coming. . . . Of course you know Effie Trumpington. She may not be able to sing for us. You know about her trouble, of course, poor dear.’ ‘And I know,’ ‘what a judge you are. Now, I hope you can manage it, my dear fellow. It’s such a joy to see people in these dreadful days when one never knows what may happen next. Did you hear the bombs in the night? I suppose they were after the camp again. I was out half the night — so tiresome! Well, eight o'clock, then. I do trust that I shan’t be called out in the middle of dinner by these fearful, inconsiderate bounders.’
‘You shall have a peep at the craters after lunch if you're good,’ ‘It makes, I think, rather a nice little contrast,’ ‘The onslaughts of barbarism in the night, the pleasures of civilisation and beauty today. You're in great good looks, Dora, dear child.’ “Tell me what you think of the Amontillado, General. I got it for a song through Bobbie Thrupp — you know, Thrupp & Cantelupe, the wine merchants in St. James's Street. I know, of course, what a judge you are.’
‘You've probably read Ursula Farmer’s Give Us This Day. Unpleasant stuff but brilliant. No doubt about that.’ ‘Sysonby of the Punjab — magnificent soldier. Grows the best roses of anyone round here.’

I had a brother there.’
‘Such a nuisance, but I'll have to go off! Don’t disturb yourselves, any of you dear people. Carter is just going to bring coffee.’ ‘If things get at all noisy, Sysonby, take the ladies under the stairs!’
