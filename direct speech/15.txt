‘The steak-and-kidney pudding is just as you like it today, Mr. Craven.’
“Wot a night!’ ‘Good evening, Mrs. Craven. Mr. Craven's waiting at your table. I’ll bring along your sherries right away.”
‘Good evening, Mrs. Craven,’
‘We're one in the sight of God and Mrs. Siddons,’ ‘You smooth me out,’ ‘You give me more peace than anyone in the world.’
‘None of the people one knows comes here,’ ‘How are you?’ ‘Fine! How are you?’ 
‘Darling, I wish we could, but you know it’s impossible. Someone would be sure to spot us, We've got to be careful — haven't we?’ ‘You know how it is, darling,’ ‘Good evening, Mrs. Craven,’ ‘You're expecting Mr. Craven? .. . Ah, that’s fine. The pigeon casserole is just how he likes it today.”
‘Don’t think I’m being stupid and morbid,’ ‘but supposing anything happens. I’ve been worrying about that. You might be wounded or ill and I wouldn’t know.’ “The War Office doesn’t have a service for sending telegrams to mistresses, does it?’
‘Darling,’ ‘don’t start getting ideas like that into your head. If anything did happen — but it won't - I'd get someone to let you know right away.’
‘I know you would,’ ‘Don’t worry about me. Remember, dearest, you don’t have to worry about me one little bit.’
‘Good night, Mrs. Craven. Good night, Mr. Craven,’
‘My goodness, aren't you getting grey!’ 
‘Is this Mrs. Craven’s house?’ “Yes. This is Jennifer. Do you want Mummy? .. . I'll get her.’
‘Good evening, Mrs. Craven,’ ‘I do want to apologise for troubling you like this. You won't know my name, but I’m an old friend of Mr. Craven's, and I’ve only just heard that he’s in Libya. I thought I'd like to ring up and see if you’ve had good news of him.’
“Why, that’s nice of you,’ ‘To tell you the truth, I've heard nothing very recently, but I try not to worry, He'll cable me when he has a minute. Judging by the papers, I shouldn't think any of them have a minute.”
‘No, I don’t suppose they have,’ 
‘Luckily, I’m tremendously busy myself. That helps to keep one’s mind off things, doesn’t it? I'm so sorry, I don’t think I quite caught the name.’
‘Just someone Mr. Craven used to know along while ago. Goodbye, Mrs. Craven, and thanks so much. I hope you hear good news very soon.’
‘I can’t go on,’ s‘I can’t, can’t go on. You'll have to break them up —I don't care. I just can’t go on this way any longer.’ 
‘Good news from Mr. Craven, Mrs. Craven?’ ‘Ah, that’s fine, that’s fine.’
