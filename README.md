# Mollie-Panter-Donwnes-wartime-short-stories
This is a repository for the final version of the abstract and poster *Sentiment Analysis and Computer-assisted Criticism: Revelation of War-Effacing Strategies in  Mollie Panter-Downesâ€™ Short Stories* at DH2024.<br>
For corpus description refer to the folder *table data*. It contains:<br>
1) text metrics - the general information about 21 shorts.
2) compound data - information about the corpus of shorts by British male and female authors and The New Yorkers writers with the proportion of female characters and sentiment difference scores.
3) estimation of characters extraction - contains data on efficiency of the NER-based algorith of extraction of lists of acting characters.
4) Panter-Downes's collection - the fragment from *compound data* which is used for making figures.
<br>
The *figures* folder contains some additional figures, not included into the original proposal.<br>
Later, I will add here figures for a poster and the poster file.
